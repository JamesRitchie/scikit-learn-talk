						This talk is about why and how to write a scikit-learn package.
						I'm going to assume most people here know what scikit-learn is.
						I'm by no means an expert, this is just what I've learned writing my own package.
						Easily enough material here for several full talks, but here's a collection of highlights,
						and by highlights I mostly mean mistakes I made which hopefully you can avoid.

						Not enough time to dive into the maths, but it's like a probabilistic Bayesian version of the SVM with a preference towards very sparse solutions.
						Can also do regression, and is related to the ARD regressor scikit-learn core.

					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Fun</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reputation</li>
						<li class="fragment">Do a lightning talk on it, guaranteed space at PyData...</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Before we go into how, why should you roll your own scikit-learn estimator?
						Fun: You can satisfy your intellectual curiosity. Writing an algorithm is a great way to improve your knowledge of ML algorithms and the scientific Python stack.
						Rep: Implementing an algorithm as a well produced package is a great way to show off many of the skills you need as a proffesional data scientist.
						Having scikit-rvm on my CV helped me land several interviews and got me my first proper data science job despite limited experience.
						PyData: Most importantly, you can guarantee yourself a slot at PyData by offering to do a lightning talk and
						avoid sitting it out on the waitlist for the inevitable rush of last minute declines.

					<h2 class="fragment">Step 1: Make it run correctly</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Implement a class with <code>fit</code> and <code>predict</code> methods</li>
						<li class="fragment">Inherit from the relevant base classes/mixins.</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Write tests
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Use trivial datasets</li>
								<li class="fragment">Consider using benchmarks</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use the <code>check_estimator</code> function</li>
						<li class="fragment">Consider using the <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template">project template</a></li>
						<li class="fragment">scikit-rvm classification was broken with uneven sample sizes!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						If you've every used scikit-learn, you know that estimators have a fit method and a predict method, and that's all you need for an MVP.
						Inheritance: This lets you use your estimator with tools like pipelines.
						Tests: How do you test something inherently non-deterministic? Use trivial examples e.g. two datapoints with an obvious optimal boundary.
						Use benchmarks with a mimnimum required score to pass. If it drops, something might be broken.
						First mistake, not using the template project. (I didn't know about it, so I wasted a lot of time bootstrapping layout, tests and CI)
						My second mistake, not testing on uneven class sample sizes. This was fixed by a pull request from Jonathan Feinberg.

					<h2 class="fragment">Step 2: Use the best algorithm</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Look through the literature for improvements</li>
						<li class="fragment">Better algorithms before low-level code optimisation!</li>
						<li class="fragment">Move older versions into tests</li>
						<li class="fragment">Example: Sequential sparse Bayes algorithm, avoids inverting very large matrices. (Cubic time complexity!!!)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now that it works correctly, time to do some low level optimizations? Not quite yet.
						Look through author's work, papers citing the original paper.
						If there's one thing you take away from this talk, make it this.
						I first implemented the naive sparse algorithm. The sequential algorithm is much better, allows you to progressivly build up to a sparse matrix, rather than progressively reducing a large non-sparse
						matrix, which takes cubic time complexity when inverting. No amount of low level optimisation can beat that.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 class="fragment">Step 3: Optimize your code</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Now you can break out the profiling tools!</li>
						<li class="fragment">Remember to compare against the older versions.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use standard Numpy optimization techniques.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Mathematical tricks may help with low level optimizations e.g. Woodbury Matrix Identity</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Don't necessarily expect Cython-ization and other compiling tricks to help.
						E.g scikit-rvm spends most of its time inside the matrix inversion routine, which is already about as optimized as it can get.
						Sometimes mathematical tricks can combine with code optimization, e.g. W M I lets you compute inversions of low rank matrix updates with a smaller inversion,
						allowing you to use a larger matrix continusouly and avoid reallocating memory by growing a matrix.
						scikit-rvm spends a lot of time changing matrice size, which I can optimize out.
